# Introduction to KaziQuick

KaziQuick is a technology that is exposing local businesses, to help local communities move out of those chunky social media groups (where thousands of advertisements that do not interest consumers, are made each hour).

## Code Structure: Model-View-Template (MVT)

KaziQ is built using the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, similar to Django's framework. Although KaziQ is a Flask project, it follows a similar structure for clarity and maintainability:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and interacts with the database. In KaziQ, models define how data is stored and manipulated.
- **View:** Handles HTTP requests and returns responses. In our case, views process user requests, interact with models to fetch or update data, and render templates.
- **Template:** Defines the user interface. Templates are used to dynamically render data passed from views, creating the HTML pages users interact with.

This structure helps keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.

### Why MVT?

The MVT structure is beneficial for KaziQ because it separates concerns effectively:

- **Data Management:** Models handle data storage and retrieval.
- **Business Logic:** Views manage the application logic.
- **User Interface:** Templates define how data is presented to users.

This separation makes the codebase more manageable and scalable.
